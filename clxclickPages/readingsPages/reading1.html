                                In the article, Carpenter reflects on the uniqueness of the “handmade web” from the
                                1990s, emphasizing its nostalgic and significant qualities. Carpenter’s concept of the
                                handmade web is both a nostalgic and significant approach, advocating for its adoption
                                to inspire meaningful personalized web development among the present commercialized web
                                space. Furthermore, Carpenter emphasizes the intimate nature of the web in 1990s.
                                Specifically, Olia Lialina’s essay “A Vernacular Web“ describes the web in the 1990s as
                                “bright, rich, personal, slow and under construction” (2005). Lialina’s description
                                highlights the intimate connections between the readers and the writers, the personality
                                of the web creators, and the desire to continuously refine and actively create the
                                pages, which are all qualities that Carpenter emphasizes that web creators should long
                                for in the article. Moreover, Carpenter connects the handmade web using the words: to
                                “code by hand”. He explains that the past code of a web page is never erased forever or
                                “dead”, but it is part of a guide that makes the “web in progress”. Like how one may
                                cross out and write over in pen to rewrite similar words to convey the same message.
                                Lastly, Carpenter longs for the nostalgia of the handmade web where he emphasizes the
                                collaboration in labour. Specifically Carpenter discusses the transformative power of
                                web pages as readers have the option of re-writing the source code. One example being
                                Nick Monfort’s “Taroko Gorge” where readers can engage in “making” or modifying the code
                                to create an interactive web. </p>

                    </ul-2>
                </nav>
                <br>
                <nav>
                    <ul-2>

                            <p>2.
                                Carpenter’s concept of the “handmade web” is a form of resistance to contemporary web
                                landscape where the contemporary web pages experienced the effects of heavy
                                commercialization, the loss of identity, and hectic social networks. The current
                                internet is dominated by big corporations that not only releases web pages that do not
                                connect with Carpenter’s concept of the “handmade web’ but they also sell products such
                                as read-only devices that encourages this interaction of the commercialized web. This is
                                why Carpenter highly advocates for “hand-coding” and the idea of publishing
                                self-projects that encourages experimental web art. Moreover, in the past the web was a
                                way to express oneself through artistic creation and create a personal identity through
                                handmade coding. Specifically Anil Dash highlights this concern as they explain that in
                                the contemporary web, there are users who will depend on commercial sites to host their
                                “online identity”. Lastly, the contemporary web are filled with social networks that
                                create chaos and noise, proving that the expectations and behaviours of the users
                                neglected from what makes the handmade web. Specifically, with social media like
                                Facebook, the labour to operate the code becomes numbing as one user may never
                                understand how Facebook will truly work and the labour required to make the code
                                deviates away from the DIY personalized approach. This is why Carpenter longs for the
                                nostalgia of the handmade web in the 1990s as he encourages for “slowness” and
                                “smallness” as a form of resistance that a web creator could use in their work. </p>

                                It should be noted the web has tangible interactions that can also be experienced in
                                the physical world. One example of this is wearable tech like the Apple Watch. The Apple
                                Watch brings the web into a physical space by providing real-time data and
                                notifications. It also refers to the concept of data collecting where the user
                                themselves have consented and can contribute their own data to the Apple Watch, such as
                                data related to their fitness and health. In other words, the presence of the watch on
                                the wrist connects the digital world to the user’s personal and unique physical
                                experience. Another example would be 3D printing. One can go on the internet and
                                download a free file to print any object, such as a cup. Furthermore, one can also
                                design a 3D object of their own with the manifestation that they will be implementing
                                this object into the physical world. So they would have to consider the physicality of
                                the material, the dimensions, and other factors all in the digital space that would
                                theoretically accurately reflect the physical space. </p>
