                            <p>1. In the article, Frank Chimero places high significance on understanding the intrinsic
                                nature of screen design. Specifically, he advocates for designers to consider the
                                properties of the screen design and prioritize the adaptability and responsiveness over
                                aesthetic considerations. By analyzing existing design case studies, Chimero emphasizes
                                the need for the digital landscape to shift towards interfaces that resonate with the
                                value of adaptability and responsiveness fostering a more inclusive and empowering
                                digital landscape. The significant factor in shaping the digital environment is through
                                the understanding of screens, no matter the type of display, size or user interaction
                                with the screen, and to prioritize user engagement and equity. It is apparent in his
                                analysis that Chimero is an advocator for the holistic approach to screen that
                                transcends the mere visual aesthetics that may be designed with the intention to replace
                                something else or for the purpose of profit. And he specifically advocates for the
                                unexplored potential of digital interfaces to serve the diverse needs through
                                flexiblity.</p>

                            <p>2. I think both of the ideological camps have their own pros and cons. Moreover with
                                Flat design, it does create a sense of harmony with the screens as a medium as they are
                                also flat in form as well. Specifically, the Flat design creates a clean, minimalist
                                look that is easy to understand and is visually appealing to many people. In terms of
                                the coding structure, Flat design allows for websites and applications to load faster as
                                there is less elements to process for the screen interface. This approach in minimalism
                                in the Flat screen design also directs the user specifically to their web interactions,
                                showing clear navigation and it avoids ambiguity in the user’s actions. Overall, flat
                                design is consistent and considers the accessibility that Chimero emphasizes in the
                                article. However, flat design can lack visual hierarchy especially when it comes to
                                display texts. This may confuse the user and in how they should navigate the web. And
                                although simplicity is good, over-simplicity can lack visual interest, therefore lacking
                                the user engagement with the screen interface. And in terms of accessibility, especially
                                with touch screen devices, flat design elements may not be tapped properly which leads
                                to the usability issues of flat design. Meanwhile Skeuo design has lots of potential to
                                create physicality in the interfaces so that the design is more intuitive and familiar.
                                Skeuo design can also create highly immersive experience by replicating that realism we
                                would experience in the physical realm. In terms of usability, Skeuo design includes
                                very clear visual cues for the users and further reduces confusion on user interaction.
                                However, the coding of Skeuo design can take longer times to load as it will deal with
                                more graphical elements. This may interfere with the user engagement and decrease their
                                interests in the site. And sometimes, Skeuo design may not be consistent throughout
                                different platforms and devices. Specifically, this may not be helpful for designing a
                                brand identity. Personally, I do like connecting the physicality of elements to the
                                digital landscape so I would choose Skeuo for the purpose being able to use visible
                                metaphors to create an engaging narrative especially for the purpose of marketing or
                                showcasing someone’s ideas.</p>

                            <p>3. A zoopraxiscope was invented by Eadweard Muybridge and it was one of the earliest
                                forms of motion picture in the 19th century. Specifically, it consisted of a set of
                                photographs that could be spun on a disk and in its motion, the photographs would create
                                the illusion of motion (i.e. the horse galloping). In terms of the web and interaction
                                design, they both create illusion of motion focusing on the perception of the users.
                                Specifically, screen interface designs can display various aspects such as animation in
                                the interface interactions. Like how the zoopraxiscope uses sequential images for
                                motion, animations on the web also use sequential images called frames to stimulate
                                movement. One example is the GIF. An example that is common in filmmaking and is common
                                in design is storyboarding. Designers use storyboarding to visualize the user journey
                                with rough sketches before advancing to their testing stages. In digital design, web
                                designers can actually map out the flow of their website both online (i.e Figma) or on
                                paper. They can prototype the interactions and experiment with visual elements before
                                going to code their implementation. Using a series of frames allows for designers to
                                ensure usability and increase user engagement in their screen designs.</p>
