    <p>FULL TEXT: All rivers have a starting point and an end point. In between these points, the river current is
        always moving
        and changing at different speeds. Flowing quickly and sometimes slowing down. At the starting point, it collects
        headwater from multiple sources to form the river, gaining knowledge. And while it is gaining, it is creating
        finite systems like servers and domains. The river flows continuously, constantly evolving and adapting to the
        erosion of the user interactions that can also wear out overtime. At unexpected rates of time, the pieces of
        sediment float with the current and the shape of the river changes overtime to create new nodes for the network
        and to better connect users in this river system. Although the user interaction may be dying, it is just
        outdated and the course of nature forms something new as a placeholder. Just as the web should be connected to
        its own world, it must also respond to its surrounding world. Like a river meandering through its surrounding.
        The river flow is also influenced by external factors such as the weather, climate change, or even human
        activity. Similar to the web such as one run by a social media platform, social and cultural trends can
        influence the content that people post online and change the flow of social media not only for themselves but
        for other's experiences.
